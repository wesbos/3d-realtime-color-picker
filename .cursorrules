## Code Completion Response Style

When finishing a coding task or making changes:
- Keep responses brief and to-the-point
- No lengthy summaries or explanations unless specifically requested
- Simply confirm what was done and move on
- Avoid verbose "here's what I implemented" sections
- Let the code speak for itself

Exception: Provide detailed explanations only when:
- User explicitly asks for explanation
- Changes are complex and need clarification
- There are important caveats or next steps
